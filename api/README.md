1. **API (Application Programming Interface):** An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, making it easier for developers to integrate and extend the functionality of existing software.

2. **REST API (Representational State Transfer API):** REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A REST API is a type of API that adheres to the principles of REST, which include using HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs typically use URLs to represent resources and return data in formats like JSON or XML.

3. **Microservices:** Microservices is an architectural approach to software development where an application is broken down into small, independently deployable services that focus on specific business functions. Each microservice operates as a separate, self-contained unit with its own database and can communicate with other microservices through APIs. This approach promotes flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance in large and complex applications.

4. **CSV Format (Comma-Separated Values):** CSV is a simple and widely used file format for storing tabular data, such as spreadsheets or databases. Data in a CSV file is organized as rows and columns, with each line representing a row of data and values separated by commas (or other delimiters). It's a plain text format that is easy to read and write, making it popular for data exchange between different applications.

5. **JSON Format (JavaScript Object Notation):** JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for both humans and machines to read and write. It uses a structured format to represent data as key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. JSON is commonly used for web APIs and configuration files due to its simplicity and compatibility with many programming languages.

6. **Pythonic Package and Module Name Style:** Pythonic package and module names typically use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words, following the "snake_case" naming convention. For example, a Python package might be named `my_utils` and a module within that package could be named `file_operations`.

7. **Pythonic Class Name Style:** Class names in Python typically use "CapWords" or "CamelCase" style, where each word within the name starts with an uppercase letter and there are no underscores. For example, a Python class name could be `MyClass` or `HttpRequestHandler`.

8. **Pythonic Variable Name Style:** Variable names in Python generally use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words, adhering to the "snake_case" convention. For instance, a variable name might be `user_age` or `data_array`.

9. **Pythonic Function Name Style:** Function names in Python follow the same convention as variable names, using lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (i.e., "snake_case"). For example, a function name could be `calculate_average` or `process_data`.

10. **Pythonic Constant Name Style:** Constants in Python are typically written in all uppercase letters with underscores to separate words, following the convention known as "UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE." For example, a constant might be defined as `MAX_VALUE` or `API_KEY`.

11. **Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python:** The use of CapWords or CamelCase in Python, where the initial letter of each word is capitalized without spaces or underscores, is a convention primarily used for naming classes and types. It helps distinguish class names from variables and functions, making code more readable and adhering to the principle of "naming conventions" in Python.
